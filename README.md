# RACTF Challenges
*Submit your challenges here in a Pull Request!*

## Challenge guidelines
1) Challenges must make sense and be solveable
2) We **will** test your challenge. If we can't solve it, it won't make it in. To avoid this possibility, give us a writeup.
3) Briefings, hints and titles are appreciated but not required.
4) Badly made, incredibly easy or stupid challenges will all be rejected. Please don't waste time making them.
5) Ping admins with your challenge idea in your safe space _before_ making it to avoid challenge duplication and rejected challenges
6) Challenges must not depend on the user having access to some kind of resource (software, books etc) that require money to get access to or use. Yes, this includes Microsoft Windows.

**Supplying a challenge**
If you supply a challenge, please send us any required information.
Web challenges can use any server type, php, node etc. Just tell us what file to run / what directory to spawn an http server in.
